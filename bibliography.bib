abstract={We give an in-depth introduction to the design of our functional array programming language SaC, the main aspects of its compilation into host machine code, and its parallelisation based on multi-threading. The language design of SaC aims at combining high-level, compositional array programming with fully automatic resource management for highly productive code development and maintenance. We outline the compilation process that maps SaC programs to computing machinery. Here, our focus is on optimisation techniques that aim at restructuring entire applications from nested compositions of general fine-grained operations into specialised coarse-grained operations. We present our implicit parallelisation technology for shared memory architectures based on multi-threading and discuss further optimisation opportunities on this level of code generation. Both optimisation and parallelisation rigorously exploit the absence of side-effects and the explicit data flow characteristic of a functional setting.},

This notation combines the basic principle of array-comprehensions with syntactical shortcuts very close to those found in the so-called Tensor Notations used in Physics and Mathematics. As a result, complex operators with rich semantics can be defined concisely. The key to this conciseness lies in the ability to define shape-polymorphic operations combined with the ability to infer array shapes from the immediate context. The paper provides a definition of the proposed notation, a formal shape inference process, as well as a set of re-write rules that translates tensor comprehensions as a zero-cost syntactic sugar into standard SaC expressions.},

abstract={We present an approach to enriching the type system of ML with a restricted form of dependent types, where type index objects are drawn from a constraint domain C, leading to the DML(C) language schema. This allows specification and inference of significantly more precise type information, facilitating program error detection and compiler optimization. A major complication resulting from introducing dependent types is that pure type inference for the enriched system is no longer possible, but we show that type-checking a sufficiently annotated program in DML(C) can be reduced to constraint satisfaction in the constraint domain C. We exhibit the unobtrusiveness of our approach through practical examples and prove that DML(C) is conservative over ML. The main contribution of the paper lies in our language design, including the formulation of type-checking rules which makes the approach practical. To our knowledge, no previous type system for a general purpose programming language such as ML has combined dependent types with features including datatype declarations, higher-order functions, general recursions, let-polymorphism, mutable references, and exceptions. In addition, we have finished a prototype implementation of DML(C) for an integer constraint domain C, where constraints are linear inequalities (Xi and Pfenning 1998).},

abstract={The array programming paradigm adopts multidimensional arrays as the fundamental data structures of computation. Array operations process entire arrays instead of just single elements. This makes array programs highly expressive and introduces data parallelism in a natural way. Array programming imposes non-trivial structural constraints on ranks, shapes, and element values of arrays. A prominent example where such constraints are violated are out-of-bound array accesses. Usually, such constraints are enforced by means of run time checks. Both the run time overhead inflicted by dynamic constraint checking and the uncertainty of proper program evaluation are undesirable. We propose a novel type system for array programs based on dependent types. Our type system makes dynamic constraint checks obsolete and guarantees orderly evaluation of well-typed programs. We employ integer vectors of statically unknown length to index array types. We also show how constraints on these vectors are resolved using a suitable reduction to integer scalars. Our presentation is based on a functional array calculus that captures the essence of the paradigm without the legacy and obfuscation of a fully-fledged array programming language.}

abstract={Rank polymorphism serves as a type of control flow used in array-oriented languages, where functions are automatically lifted to operate on high-dimensional arguments. The iteration space is derived directly from the shape of the data, presenting a challenge to compilation. A type system can characterize data shape, though the level of detail is beyond what can be reasonably expected from entirely human-generated annotations. The task of checking or inferring shapes can be phrased as solving constraints in the theory of the free monoid over the natural numbers, but the constraints involve both universal and existential quantification. Here is a plan of attack for leveraging past work on decision procedures, which has generally focused on the purely existential fragment of the theory.},

abstract={Dependent types have emerged in recent years as a promising approach to ensuring program correctness. However, existing dependently typed languages such as Agda and Coq work at a very high level of abstraction, making it difficult to map verified programs to suitably efficient executable code. This is particularly problematic for programs which work with bit level data, e.g. network packet processing, binary file formats or operating system services. Such programs, being fundamental to the operation of computers in general, may stand to benefit significantly from program verification techniques. This paper describes the use of a dependently typed programming language, Idris, for specifying and verifying properties of low-level systems programs, taking network packet processing as an extended example. We give an overview of the distinctive features of Idris which allow it to interact with external systems code, with precise types. Furthermore, we show how to integrate tactic scripts and plugin decision procedures to reduce the burden of proof on application developers. The ideas we present are readily adaptable to languages with related type systems.},

The main difference between Haskell and Cayenne is that Cayenne has dependent types, i.e., the result type of a function may depend on the argument value, and types of record components (which can be types or values) may depend on other components. Cayenne also combines the syntactic categories for value expressions and type expressions; thus reducing the number of language concepts.Having dependent types and combined type and value expressions makes the language very powerful. It is powerful enough that a special module concept is unnecessary; ordinary records suffice. It is also powerful enough to encode predicate logic at the type level, allowing types to be used as specifications of programs. However, this power comes at a cost: type checking of Cayenne is undecidable. While this may appear to be a steep price to pay, it seems to work well in practice.},

We describe the CCured type system, which extends that of C by separating pointer types according to their usage. This type system allows both pointers whose usage can be verified statically to be type safe, and pointers whose safety must be checked at run time. We prove a type soundness result and then we present a surprisingly simple type inference algorithm that is able to infer the appropriate pointer kinds for existing C programs.Our experience with the CCured system shows that the inference is very effective for many C programs, as it is able to infer that most or all of the pointers are statically verifiable to be type safe. The remaining pointers are instrumented with efficient run-time checks to ensure that they are used safely. The resulting performance loss due to run-time checks is 0-150\%, which is several times better than comparable approaches that use only dynamic checking. Using CCured we have discovered programming bugs in established C programs such as several SPECINT95 benchmarks.},

First, in order to express efficient code inside the parallel constructs, we introduce a simple type system for in-place updates that ensures referential transparency and supports equational reasoning. Second, we furnish Futhark with parallel operators capable of expressing efficient strength-reduced code, along with their fusion rules. Third, we present a flattening transformation aimed at enhancing the degree of parallelism that (i) builds on loop interchange and distribution but uses higher-order reasoning rather than array-dependence analysis, and (ii) still allows further locality-of-reference optimisations. Finally, an evaluation on 16 benchmarks demonstrates the impact of the language and compiler features and shows application-level performance competitive with hand-written GPU code.},

For those programs where this is not sufficient, we support a form of existential types, with the type system automatically managing the requisite book-keeping. We formalise a large subset of the type system in a small core language, which we prove sound. We also present an integration of the type system in the high-performance parallel functional language Futhark, and show on a collection of 44 representative programs that the restrictions in the type system are not too problematic in practice.},

More specifically, certain program fragments are marked dependent, in which case the programmer annotates them in detail and a dependent type checker verifies them at compile time. Other fragments are marked simple, in which case they may be annotation-free and dependent constraints are verified at run time.",

abstract={This paper presents a static type system for JAVA Virtual Machine (JVM) code that enforces an access control mechanism similar to the one found, for example, in a JAVA implementation. In addition to verifying type consistency of a given JVM code, the type system statically verifies that the code accesses only those resources that are granted by the prescribed access policy. The type system is proved to be sound with respect to an operational semantics that enforces access control dynamically, similarly to JAVA stack inspection. This result ensures that "well typed code cannot violate access policy." The paper then develops a type inference algorithm and shows that it is sound with respect to the type system and that it always infers a minimal set of access privileges. These results allows us to develop a static system for JVM access control without resorting to costly runtime stack inspection.},

abstract={We present a type-based approach to eliminating array bound checking and list tag checking by conservatively extending Standard ML with a restricted form of dependent types. This enables the programmer to capture more invariants through types while type-checking remains decidable in theory and can still be performed efficiently in practice. We illustrate our approach through concrete examples and present the result of our preliminary experiments which support support the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract={Arrays are intensively used in many software programs, including those in the popular graphics and game programming domains. Although the problem of eliminating redundant array bound checks has been studied for a long time, there are few works that attempt to be both aggressively precise and practical. We propose an inference mechanism that achieves both aims by combining a forward relational analysis with a backward precondition derivation. Our inference algorithm works for a core imperative language with assignments, and analyses each method once through a summary-based approach. Our inference is precise as it is both path and context sensitive. Through a novel technique that can strengthen preconditions, we can selectively reduce the sizes of formulae to support a practical inference algorithm. Moreover, we subject each inferred program to a flexivariant specialization that can achieve good tradeoff between elimination of array checks and code explosion concerns. We have proven the soundness of our approach and have also implemented a prototype inference and specialization system. Initial experiments suggest that such a desired system is viable.},

abstract={We present a dependent type system for enforcing array-size
consistency in an ML-style functional array language. Our goal is
to enforce shape-consistency at compile time and allow nontrivial
transformations on array shapes, without the complexity such
features tend to introduce in dependently typed languages. Sizes
can be arbitrary expressions and size equality is purely
syntactical, which fits naturally within a scheme that interprets
size-polymorphic functions as having implicit arguments. When
non-syntactical equalities are needed, we provide dynamic checking.
In contrast to other dependently typed languages, we automate the
book-keeping involved in tracking existential sizes, such as when
filtering arrays. We formalise a large subset of the presented type
system and prove it sound. We also discuss how to adapt the type
system for a real implementation, including type inference, within
the Futhark programming language.},

abstract="We present a type-based program analysis capable of inferring expressive invariants over array programs. Our system combines dependent types with two additional key elements. First, we associate dependent types with effects and precisely track effectful array updates, yielding a sound flow-sensitive dependent type system that can capture invariants associated with side-effecting array programs. Second, without imposing an annotation burden for quantified invariants on array indices, we automatically infer useful array invariants by initially guessing very coarse invariant templates, using test suites to exercise the functionality of the program to faithfully instantiate these templates with more precise (likely) invariants. These inferred invariants are subsequently encoded as dependent types for validation. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our approach, with respect to both expressivity of the invariants inferred, and the time necessary to converge to a result.",

abstract={Pattern matching allows programs both to extract specific information from complex data types, as well as to branch on the structure of data and thus apply specialized actions to different forms of data. Originally designed for strongly typed functional languages with algebraic data types, pattern matching has since been adapted for object-oriented and even dynamic languages. This paper discusses how pattern matching can be included in the dynamically typed language Python in line with existing features that support extracting values from sequential data structures.},

abstract="Non-free data types are data types whose data have no canonical forms. For example, multisets are non-free data types because the multiset {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}a,b,b{\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}has two other equivalent but literally different forms {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}b,a,b{\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}b,b,a{\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}. Pattern matching is known to provide a handy tool set to treat such data types. Although many studies on pattern matching and implementations for practical programming languages have been proposed so far, we observe that none of these studies satisfy all the criteria of practical pattern matching, which are as follows: (i) efficiency of the backtracking algorithm for non-linear patterns, (ii) extensibility of matching process, and (iii) polymorphism in patterns.",
